Fun project im working on while trying to learn React, and working with Google's cloud vision ML tool



If you want to run it locally, You will need to create your own google cloud project and enable the cloud vision api.

Then Add the credentials to  `.env` as `GCLOUD_CREDS`

Use commands:

`npm install`

`npm run start-dev`
